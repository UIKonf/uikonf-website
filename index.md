    For UIKonf 2019 we decided to present you a special edition with an amazing all female speaker line up. We therefore decided to pause the CfP for this year and invite all speakers personally. However, if you would like to speak or suggest someone, please <a href="mailto:engin@uikonf.com" target="_blank">reach out to Engin</a>.

    As a speaker, your travel expenses will be reimbursed and you will be our guests at our selected Hotel in Berlin. Of course, we will also reimburse you for your ticket if you already have purchased one.

    A central part of UIKonf are the social events on the Sunday before the conference. Not only do you get to enjoy Berlin for a day but they also give you a first opportunity to get to know other participants of the conference in a fun atmosphere.

    These are some events we offered in previous years:
