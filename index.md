    UIKonf is Berlin’s independent [remote] conference for serious iOS developers. Livestreaming from May 18th to 19th, it is a great place to meet and connect with experienced developers from all over the world.

    UIKonf features inspiring speakers giving talks on cutting edge topics in iOS development, mobile design and business.

    But UIKonf is not only about gathering knowledge. We want to facilitate new
    connections and friends amongst our great community by providing an inclusive setting where all participants feel safe and welcome. In order to achieve that, we expect all to abide by our <a href="coc">Code of Conduct</a>

    UIKonf hosts a diverse selection of inspiring speakers. We select and invite about half of our speakers. The other half is selected by our community through our anonymous call for proposals system. Details below.

    #### CfP is in voting mode
    
    Together with a few former speakers we went through the whole list of 120+ proposals, read every single one of them, discussed most of them and came up with a short-list of 53. The decision wasn't easy, but we are pretty happy with the list.

    Now it's your turn to vote: Log in with your github account and select at least 3 of your favorite talks that you would like to hear at UIKonf.

    A word of caution: If you're an author and invite your colleagues to only vote for your talk, we will notice. So, please don't do that.

    PRO TIP: To keep the first few talks from being the only ones to get read and voted on, the order of the proposals changes every time you open the page, so it's best to open the proposal list once and open the individual proposals in new tabs.

    Happy voting! :)

    A central part of UIKonf are the social events on the Sunday before the conference. This year, we have come up with creative ways to “remotely” get to interact with one another to give you a first opportunity to get to know other participants of the conference in a fun atmosphere.
    
    The events we offered in previous years will be adapted in a creative and fun way
