<p>Martijn Walraven lives in Amsterdam and works remotely as an open source developer at Meteor / Apollo. He is focused on bringing GraphQL to mobile developers, and is the creator of a strongly-typed, caching GraphQL client for iOS written in Swift. He holds a bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degree in philosophy and cognitive science from Leiden University, as part of which he spent a year as an exchange student at UC San Diego. In recent years he has taught philosophy to high school students, and one of his ambitious long term goals is to explore programming as a way to improve people&rsquo;s learning and thinking.</p>
