<p>Andreas Oetjen started developing software in the mid-90's, almost always in large scale projects in different OO languages (C++, Java, C#).
He got interested in iOS development in 2009, and since he's convinced that the best way to learn anything is to teach others, he soon became a trainer for Objective C / Swift software developers and started giving lectures on several conferences.</p>
<p>Besides this, he is a passionate marathon runner and tries to juggle his hobby with interesting city trips in Europe (and sometimes even farther away)</p>
