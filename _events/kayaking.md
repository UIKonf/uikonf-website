  Hop on kayaks and paddle with other UIKonf attendees longside some of Berlins sweetest spots – through the hip Neukölln and Kreuzberg to the marvelous Oberbaumbrücke and the East harbour. Enjoy the stunning waterscape of the legendary Landwehrkanal and the Spree River and discover an unexpected oasis in the middle of the city caused by a switch of your perspective and the kind of movement.
