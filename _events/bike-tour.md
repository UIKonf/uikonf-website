<p>A guided bicycle tour is the best way to discover Berlin. You’ll enjoy the city’s expansive, green and primarily flat urban landscape. On routes, almost entirely separated from automobile traffic, our guides will take you to some of Berlin’s most interesting, exciting and unexpected places. We provide the bikes, all you have to bring is your curiosity, a little bit of leg strength, good mood and something to cover yourself should it start to rain.</p>
