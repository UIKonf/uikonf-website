To be honest, no one will keep you from joining several events, so you might just want to do some sports before joining the BBQ, too. Not sure yet how to do this together (on your stationary bike at home?) but we created a [Strava event](https://www.strava.com/clubs/603614/group_events/681330) you can sign up for. Let’s see how many miles / kilometers we can log together. We also created a [Twitter collection](https://twitter.com/uikonf/timelines/1261577453937610753) for you to follow along. 

Start: At your own time
