Another UIKonf Classic is back - get a glimpse of the old [airport of Tempelhof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Tempelhof_Airport). As one of the first public airports world-wide, it served as a US military base during WWII and was crucial for the survival of West-Berlin’s citizens during the Berlin Blockade. Inside, the building seems to be frozen in time, making its history is still very tangible. Outside, the airfield has become Berliners’ favorite place for running, kite- and roller-skating or just relaxing in the sun.
