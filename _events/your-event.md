Your company provides a product that brings people together preferably for free - or maybe even guided tours (hello GetYourGuide people 👋, please nudge your Marketing Department for us)?  
Do you have a story to tell or an interesting hobby that helps you keep your sanity right now - would that make for a fun event?  
Or do you have other fun ideas which are easily translatable to “remote” and bring people together?  
[Contact us](mailto:questions@uikonf.com) and let’s see how we can create a fun social event together. 💙
