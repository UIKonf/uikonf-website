	Every now and then, a bizarre and wonderful attraction lies just off the beaten track, seemingly existing only to beckon to the traveler who has seen it all. Berlin’s Spreepark is just that attraction – a massive, surreal amusement park opened in 1969 and abandoned in 2002. Famous amongst urban exploration aficionados and purveyors of so-called ‘ruin porn,’ In the guided tour through the exciting terrain you can explore parts of the currently closed areas and learn about the eventful history of the former amusement park.
