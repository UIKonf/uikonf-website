Dominion is a card game that feels like a strategic board game, for the gaming nerds: A deck building game. It starts kind of simple, but advanced players may choose from a variety of ~ 500 card types, so this game won’t get boring any time soon. We’ll meet on zoom and break out into separate virtual playing tables of 4 people. If you’ve played before, you may peer up with other advanced players. For starters, you’ll get an intro and start with basic cards. No physical games required.
