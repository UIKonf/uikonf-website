<p>Tempelhof Airport was one of the first air traffic airports world-wide. It was opened in 1923 and partly destroyed during WWII. It subsquently became a base for the US Air Force and a vital airport during the blockage of West-Berlin supplying people with food from so-called "raisin bombers". The airport was closed in 2008 opening a huge green space to the public. A lot of its history has been preserved inside.
