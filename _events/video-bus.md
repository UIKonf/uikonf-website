Specially trained guides will take you on a city bus tour to the most important moments of the Berlin´s past. The journey through time will take you from the Kaiser’s booming empire to the turbulent Golden Twenties, from the horrors of Nazism to the brutal dissection of the city during the Cold War, and from the fall of the wall in 1989 to the re-united bustling metropolis of today. On monitors you will be shown historical picture and film documents in the original locations of Berlin's history. You have not seen Berlin like that before!
