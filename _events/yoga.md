Can’t do a handstand? Don’t worry, we can’t either, but we convinced health coach and yoga teacher [Ali Divita ](https://www.yogali.health/) to hold a yoga class for us – and maybe give us some tips on how to do a handstand. After the class you can also ask questions about immunity, sleep, handling stress, or emotional wellness and mental health. Bring your mat and comfortable clothes. Any levels welcome - though it might be easier if you’ve done Yoga before. Namaste!
