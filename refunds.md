## Refund Policy

It is a good idea to book your UIKonf ticket early to make sure you get one. On the other hand, booking so early is not easy because life is life and there are unexpected circumstances. That is why we have a very flexible refund and transfer policy:

- The tickets are transferable until four weeks before the event.
- The tickets are fully refundable up to 2 months before the event
- The tickets can be refunded from 2 months before the event until 4 weeks before the event at 100€ + VAT penalty.
- The tickets are not refundable and all sales are final in the 4 weeks before the event.

## Refunds for PayPal Orders 

Due to PayPal rules, we cannot refund your ticket after 60 days. So if you paid with PayPal, it is either the deadlines above or 60 days after purchase whichever comes first.
