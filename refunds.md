# Refund Policy

It is a good idea to book your UIKonf ticket early to make sure you get one. On the other hand, booking so early is not easy because life is life and there are unexpected circumstances. 

That is why we have a very flexible refund and transfer policy: you can refund your ticket and get the full purchase price back or transfer to somebody else with no penalty until March 2nd.

From March 3rd until May 3rd, there is a 100€ (excl. VAT) penalty for refunds but you can transfer your ticket to somebody else with no extra cost.

After May 4th, we don't accept any refunds and transfers any more.
