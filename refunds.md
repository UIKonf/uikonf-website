description: UIKonf - Berlin's independent iOS conference â€“ Refunding or Transferring Tickets
---

## Refund Policy

It is a good idea to book your UIKonf ticket early to make sure you get one. On the other hand, booking so early is not easy because life is life and there are unexpected circumstances. That is why we have a very flexible refund and transfer policy:

- **Until April 14:** Cancellation will cause a penalty of 10 Euro to cover our transaction fees.
- **From April 15 until May 10:** Tickets are transferrable, but not refundable.
- **From May 11:** All sales are final, no refunds nor transfers are allowed.

## Refunds for PayPal Orders 

Due to PayPal rules, we cannot refund your ticket after 60 days. So if you paid with PayPal, it is either the deadlines above or 60 days after purchase whichever comes first. 


## Disclaimer regarding cancellation
The organizer of UIKonf reserves the right, but takes no obligation, to cancel the conference in case of an upcoming serious risk to health and integrity of the participants (i.e., but not limited to, epi-/pandemic health disease). When this is the case is exclusively up to the discretion of the organizer of the conference and does not premise a warning or interdiction of governmental authorities. Notwithstanding the aforementioned refunding policy, in case of cancellation due to serious health and integrity risk the liability of UIKonf is limited to refund the conference fee paid. Any further cost of or consequential damages to the participants are excluded.
The relationship of the participants with UIKonf is governed exclusively by German law.
