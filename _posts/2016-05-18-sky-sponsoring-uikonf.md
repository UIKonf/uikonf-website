One of the sponsors contributing to this year's UIKonf is the media company Sky. As one of Europe's biggest entertainment companies, Sky might not seem like the obvious candidate to be interested in a grass-roots, artisan iOS dev-fest like UIKonf. But unsurprisingly, technology is right at the heart of Sky's business and mobile is at the front and center of how the company wishes to offer content, services and interact with its customers.

In fact, over the last 18 months Sky has been growing a brand new technology base in Leeds. Itâ€™s currently home to around 350 Developers, Designers, Analysts and Testers. [Sky@LeedsDock](https://youtu.be/14L9j28_EHE) has a strong Mobile Developer team of 40 plus engineers split roughly 50/50 across iOS and Android, working on a wide range of apps for exploring Sky's Sports, Movies, News and Kids content as well as apps for managing your account and remote recording.

Entertainment and TV is a fast changing, competitive business and this makes for an exciting and diverse project landscape with new campaigns and products driving the need for constant innovation and new features.

As an iOS developer at Sky this translates into opportunities to work on greenfield app projects completely written in Swift (or Kotlin for Android) as well as contributing to established Objective-C products, many of which are incorporating Swift for new features and testing. Frequent change also means there is an ongoing need to experiment, explore and spike new features or APIs. Sky@LeedsDock is striving to nurture an environment for engineers that values community,  collaboration, constant learning and sharing via internal and external open source.

Developing agile ways of working focused on learning is a key part of   the culture that Sky@LeedsDock aims to build. Taking inspiration from the [Spotify Tribe model](https://youtu.be/Mpsn3WaI_4k), iOS developers work in largely autonomous, cross-functional, self-organising teams of 6-10 people including Analysts, Designers, Testers and Product Owners with end-to-end responsibility for the design and build of our apps. This team-level autonomy gives plenty of scope for selecting our own tech stack and dev tools, whilst a cross-team mobile engineering guild provides a broader forum in which to discuss and agree on best practice and alignment across multiple teams.   

The Sky@LeedsDock model offers a lot of flexibility and this is reflected in our tech stack of Objective-C, Swift, ReactNative, Ruby, node, Elixir, Scala, Go, GraphQL, Calabash & CloudFoundry and in the range of dev tools teams use including GitHub, CircleCI, AppCode, RubyMine, Dash, Sketch and Slack. 

Underpinning the flexibility and autonomy enjoyed by our iOS developers, Sky@LeedsDock offers a great location with exciting new working spaces, an inclusive and international team of colleagues and plenty of challenging projects.
