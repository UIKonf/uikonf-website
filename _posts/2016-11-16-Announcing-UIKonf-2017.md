Sabine, Maxim and I took over the responsibility of organizing UIKonf from Chris, Peter and Matt late 2014. 2015 was the first UIKonf we organized and it was an amazing learning experience for all of us. Being first time organizers we tried to stick to the original team's playbook as much as we could. The only significant change we did was the introduction of the social events on the sunday before the conference. We can't thank the UIKonf community enough for the trust you placed in us and made UIKonf 2015 a success. 

UIKonf 2015 went by in an adrenaline induced blur and 2016 was the first time we had the slightest idea what we were doing. We took  the feedback we received from the previous year to heart and revamped our double blind talk proposal system, doubled down on social events, tried to use them to raise some money for charity and last but not the least added live streaming and live captioning. To be honest, we were slightly worried if we'd sell any tickets at all if we live stream all talks but the UIKonf community proved our worries completely unfounded by buying all the tickets: UIKonf 2016 sold out about 2 months before the conference.

Which brings me to our biggest problem in the last two years: capacity. UIKonf called Heimathafen home since the beginning. Heimathafen is a great venue with its unique charm but unfortunately it has a limited capacity outside the main conference hall. We ran into logistical problems with catering and coffee and were not able to accommodate more people. We are fully aware that increasing the capacity of a conference like UIKonf runs the risk of diluting the friendly and inclusive spirit but we believe it is also important to make the event accessible to more people in order to increase diversity. 

That's why we have been talking to various venues in Berlin to enable us have more space for new ideas and a more diverse group of great people. As we quickly found out that as the event venues get bigger they tend become standard issue corporate event locations the expected lack of charm and unreasonable increase in costs. However we are extremely happy to report that our new location Kosmos Berlin hits a sweet spot: we are going to be able to realize new ideas and have more great people without breaking the bank and hold UIKonf in a special location originally built in the 60'ies as a movie theater in the communist East Berlin.
