description: Changes in the organizer team of UIKonf
---

In September 2014, Engin, Maxim and Sabine were approached by Chris, Max, Peter and Matt asking if we were interested in taking over organizing UIKonf. Little did we know what we would get ourselves into... But we all thought that this project - a welcoming conference run by a few members of the community for the community - needed to continue and we were excited about this new challenge. Since we didn’t want to waste time setting up a new company and everything that came with it, we decided to run the project under Engin’s existing one, Fifteen Jugglers.

Five successful conference years later, Engin has decided to dedicate his time to other challenges. (You can follow him and his adventures on twitter.) 

We want to thank Engin for the exciting five years we’ve been organizing and growing UIKonf together and for the courage of lending his our company for this purpose. We all played a big role in making UIKonf successful. However, it would not have been as easy and fun without Engin and Fifteen Jugglers.
