## Conference Updates
We just published tickets for our Social Events. If you haven‚Äôt booked your ticket for UIKonf yet, then please do so now because **you need your UIKonf ticket reference** to register for our Social 
Events.  
[Register for a social event](https://ti.to/uikonf/uikonf-2020-social-events). 

After lots of research, we have settled on a platform to run our event: We will be using [Hopin](https://hopin.to) since it provides lots of opportunities for networking. To still provide you with the best possible life-streaming experience, we will mix it up with other technologies but you won‚Äôt notice much of this as an attendee.

**The conference will consist of four components:**  
1. The Main Stage ‚Äì This is where you can follow our talks and post your questions in the chat.
2. Sessions ‚Äì Here you can:  
    - Join our extended live Q&As  
    - Participate in a workshop  
    - Hold an impromptu talk on our side stage  
    - Mingle with other attendees  
    - Contact us via the Help Desk if you have any questions  
3. Networking ‚Äì This is a place to meet [random] strangers. Our [Code of Conduct](https://uikonf.com/coc/) applies here, too.
4. Expo ‚Äì Learn more about our sponsors and talk to them during their "office hours". 

We will be sending out invite links to sign up in the next couple of days.

## Speaker Updates
Get excited! Our preliminary [schedule](https://uikonf.com/#schedule) is now available (pending feedback from our speakers) and we updated our [speaker page](https://uikonf.com/speakers/) with all talk titles and summaries or links to the CfP.

Also, if you want to meet our speakers already and are, for example, interested to see what Paul Hudson‚Äôs dog has to say about SwiftUI, you can now do so through our short interview series on Youtube. UIKonf‚Äôs long-term supporter, Jeff Watkins, put a lot of work into interviewing everyone - thank you, Jeff üíô New videos are released daily - subscribe to our [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdr22uU_wISpB3ZPi6C7ZTYPbA1rfd2Dl) or follow us on twitter so you don‚Äôt miss a thing!

Unfortunately our speaker Dave DeLong had to cancel his attendance due to the still pending approval of his talk by his employer. :( We will announce his replacement next week!

## UIKonf Swag Shop
Did anyone say ‚Äúswag‚Äù? üòçYes yes‚Ä¶ this year you can get your shirt (or cap / cup / apron) for UIKonf 2020 delivered right to your doorstep!
