<h2>Maxim Cramer</h2>
<p>Maxim currently works at SwiftKey where she had the privilege to be part of developing and launching SwiftKey Keyboard for iOS. Starting off with digital design at a young age, she grew curious about programming and so pursued it professionally, yet never straying far from UI/UX. Passionate about humans, she advocates testing products with people first and foremost, always enjoying the looks of surprise, confusion, and delight.</p>

<p>Natasha is a Swift enthusiast who writes about her experiences with this still developing language on <a href="http://natashatherobot.com/" about="_blank">natashatherobot.com</a>. She is currently working as an iOS engineer for Capital One in San Francisco and is also introducing beginners to mobile app development at General Assembly.</p>
