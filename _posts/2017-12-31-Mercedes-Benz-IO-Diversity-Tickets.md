We are very happy to announce that Mercedes-Benz.io is supporting [UIKonf's diversity program](https://goo.gl/forms/Yc9nomeec9OUnRoY2) and helps us bring 30 members of underrepresented groups in tech to UIKonf 2018. This includes but isn’t limited to: women, people of colour, LGBTQIA+ people, and disabled people and generally people who are unable to attend without financial assistance. 

We want to thank Mercedes-Benz.io for their generous support.
