<p>Happy New Year everyone! We are very happy to announce <a href="/2015/01/11/maxim-cramer-natasha-murashev.html"> Natasha (the Robot) Murashev and Maxim Cramer</a> as confirmed speakers for UIKonf 2015 as well as the opening the call for paper for UIKonf 2015.</p>


<p><i>Submit your proposal for UIKonf 2015</i><br/>Everyone can participate in the process of selecting the talks for this year's UIKonf by either proposing a talk or commenting on proposals. The idea is simple. You propose a presentation. Others will help refine and focus it by making suggestions. You keep updating your proposal bearing those suggestions in mind. At some point (yet to be determined), weâ€™ll then collectively whittle down the set of proposals to those that have been selected for the day.</p>

<p>Talks should be no longer than 30 minutes plus discussion time. To get an idea which topics are most sought after, <a href="/2015/01/11/survey-results-call-for-paper.html">read what people told us in our survey</a>. We are looking forward to your proposals!</p>
