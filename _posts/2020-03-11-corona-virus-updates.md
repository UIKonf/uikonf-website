Published March 10th, please check our [blog]({{site.baseurl}}/blog) for further updates.

<p>Right now, it&#39;s not looking great, so we are a bit anxious about UIKonf. Businesses are restricting unnecessary travel and Berlin has called off events over 500 people in publicly funded venues until mid April. Even though UIKonf happens a month later and we would be just below the cut-off size for the government to close our doors, we see it as our responsibility to protect everyone&#39;s well-being (more than blindly following rules).</p>

<p>Despite the current situation, <strong>we still think it&#39;s too early to call UIKonf off</strong>. Even if we quit now we would have cancellation costs which don&rsquo;t change substantially until later in April and the situation might lighten up until then. That&#39;s why we continue inviting and announcing speakers. However, since no-one can foresee the future, we encourage everyone to <strong>get travel insurance for</strong> their visit to UIKonf and thoroughly <strong>check the cancellation policy of their hotel and flights</strong> - just in case.</p>

<p>For the case that things clear up and we can continue as planned, we are looking into ways how people - attendees and speakers alike - can also join the party remotely. We are talking to our venue about additional sanitation (e.g. hand-washing stations outside) as well as giving people additional rooms to watch the live-stream, so that the likelihood of a spread is reduced. And we are looking into other possible entry vectors - like distributing food in containers or have staff to serve it instead of having everyone serve themselves. We will update you with a <strong>full list of protective measures</strong> closer to the conference, please be assured that we will do our best to help everyone protect themselves.</p>

<p>If after all, we really need to cancel the physical event, it will probably be our own decision and not force majeure - meaning you would get reimbursed for your ticket. Still we would be really, really happy about a donation to help cover the costs. <strong>In that case we will also try to continue as a remote conference</strong>, so you could convert your ticket to a remote ticket. We are currently figuring out the technical implications of that.</p>
