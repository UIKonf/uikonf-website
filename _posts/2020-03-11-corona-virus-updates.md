Published March 10th, please check our [blog]({{site.baseurl}}/blog) for further updates.

<p>Despite the current situation, we still think it&#39;s <strong>too early to call UIKonf off</strong>. Cancelling the event is expensive, as there are costs we will not recoup. The good thing is, this is not going to change until later in April, and the situation may look better by then. That&#39;s why we&#39;ve decided to continue for now. However, since no-one can foresee the future, we encourage everyone to <strong>get travel insurance</strong> for their visit to UIKonf and thoroughly <strong>check the cancellation policy of their hotel and flights</strong> - just in case.</p>

<p>For the case that things clear up and we can continue as planned, we are looking into ways where people - attendees and speakers alike - can also join the party remotely. We are talking to our venue about additional measures to reduce the likelihood of spreading disease: hand-washing stations outside, additional smaller viewing rooms, closed lunch containers, etc. We will update you with a <strong>full list of protective measures closer to the conference</strong>, please be assured that we will do our best to help everyone protect themselves.</p>

<p>If after all, we really need to cancel the physical event, it will probably be our own decision and not force majeure - meaning you would get reimbursed for your ticket. Still we would be really, really happy about a donation to help cover the costs. <strong>In that case we will also try to continue as a remote conference</strong>, so you could convert your ticket to a remote ticket. We are currently figuring out the technical implications of that.</p>
