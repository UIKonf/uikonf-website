		<p><i>We are ...</i><br/>
		Engin Kurutepe (iOS developer and organizer of CocoaHeads Berlin)<br/>
		Maxim Zaks (iOS Game Developer)<br/>
		Sabine Geithner (iOS Developer and co-organizer of Rails Girls Berlin)<br/>

		<p>We are honored and excited to organize the UIKonf 2015. In the last weeks we have been collecting new ideas to make the conference even greater and even confirmed the first speakers. More informations will follow soon.</p>
