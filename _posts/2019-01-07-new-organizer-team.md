description: New organizer team for UIKonf 2019
---

Our beloved co-organiser and <strong>your favorite MC </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/iceX33" target="_blank"><strong>Maxim</strong></a> has decided to dedicate more time building apps. After organising 4 editions of UIKonf together, we understand and respect this decision. All of us organisers are juggling a fulltime job, family / friends and UIKonf organisation which can be quite stressful at times.<br />
We are super proud of how UIKonf has developed and continuously improved in these past years. And this journey would not have been possible without Maxim. So thank you, Maxim! We are grateful to have had you in our team and will miss you dearly. ðŸ’™

At the same time we are happy to welcome two new organizers in our team:
Our long-term volunteer <a href="https://twitter.com/KallenbergJulia" target="_blank"><strong>Julia Kallenberg</strong></a> has decided to join us as a &quot;fulltime&quot; organiser and will take over communication and website management while Sabine (that&#39;s me ðŸ‘‹) is escaping the cold Berlin winter for a short sabbatical. Julia is an iOS Developer at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nebenan.de/" target="_blank">nebenan.de</a>. She is also an avid traveler and a former project manager for renewable energies.

Also joining us as an organizer is <a href="https://twitter.com/biancawalty" target="_blank"><strong>Bianca Walterspiel Stromlund</strong></a>&nbsp;who will be supporting us with sponsor relationships. During the day, Bianca is managing Global Engineering Relations at Delivery Hero.

And we have three constants: Supporting the team as a professional event manager will again be <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinebraun" target="_blank"><strong>Christine Braun</strong></a> (who is also happy to help organizing <strong>your</strong> professional event). And last but not least, Engin and Sabine will still be rocking UIKonf for you. We are looking forward to seeing you again!<br />
