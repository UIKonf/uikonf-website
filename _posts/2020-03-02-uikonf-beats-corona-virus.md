description: UIKonf will happen. We updated our terms.

Published March 2nd, please check our [blog]({{site.baseurl}}/blog) for further updates.

Due to the corona virus, some of you might have started to wonder if UIKonf will be happening this year at all. The answer is: yes, unless we are ordered by the government to cancel the event.

We‚Äôve been following the corona virus crisis closely. Of course there is no prediction on how this virus will develop since it is completely new, but if it is anything like the most flu-like viruses, it is most likely going to die down with the onset of warmer weather. UIKonf is still more than 2 months away. By then summer will already be in the air. We therefore believe that this will blow over before UIKonf so that we will all be able to come together as planned.

To make sure UIKonf survives, we updated our [refunds policy]({{site.baseurl}}/refunds) as well as our [terms of service]({{site.baseurl}}/terms/) for the case of cancellation.

**Our contingency plan**  
Of course there is still a risk for which we need to take precautions. Organising the average UIKonf costs A LOT of money. A financial risk that Julia and Sabine are currently carrying on our own. Some of these costs are fixed like the venue, some are variable (up to a point in time) like the catering, t-shirts, social events, etc. Let‚Äôs add some transparency:

There are two important scenarios for us we need to consider when assessing our risk: The first one being that UIKonf takes place but a lot of people cancel last minute so that we sell fewer tickets than needed to break even. The second one: If the corona virus continues to spread and does not die down, there is a chance that the German government orders us to cancel the event.

Risk 1: Lower attendance  
To mitigate the financial loss in case of lower attendance rates, we might have to limit the costs of our social events (free bike tours for all üéâ) and might also not offer t-shirts this year. We are still compiling a list of things we could cut without impacting the experience of UIKonf. 

Since there is also a chance that some speakers might not be able to travel after all, we might ask some people at the top of the CfP rating, who didn‚Äôt ‚Äúmake the cut‚Äù to prepare their talk anyway as back-up. Of course this would be completely voluntary.

Risk 2: Cancellation due to a force majeure  
There is still a slight chance that the virus does not die down. We will continue watching the situation and reserve the right to cancel the conference to protect you, our sponsors and ourselves from financial loss, even though right now we are determined to make this UIKonf happen. However, should the situation suddenly worsen, we might be ordered to cancel the event by a governmental organisation - this event is called a ‚Äúforce majeure‚Äù (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_majeure)).

We amended our terms of service to clarify that German law applies in case of force majeure. This means that in this quite unlikely case we will not be obliged to refund your ticket. After covering all open costs, we would of course return as much money as is left, however, we can‚Äôt tell you how much that might be (it could be zero).

Furthermore, we are adding a clause that frees us from any liability regarding any additional costs you might have for visiting UIKonf. We recommend getting travel insurance for your journey for the case of cancellation.

If you already purchased a ticket, we will inform you about our updated terms shortly. You will then have 2 weeks to cancel your ticket without costs, if you don‚Äôt agree with these new terms.

**We will survive**  

UIKonf has been around for 7 years now. It was founded and lived on to help you, our community, to connect with others and grow your circle of experts. In these not-so-easy times the future of UIKonf depends on you. Help us keep it alive, by attending, spreading the word about UIKonf, and being understanding about this rather strict refund policy.

See you all in May!

Sabine, Julia, Bianca and Chrissy
