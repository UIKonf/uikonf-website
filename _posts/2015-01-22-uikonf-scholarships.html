<p>Since UIKonf started, we offered student tickets at greatly reduced price to make it easier for the members of our community who are just starting out and can't afford the full price, yet.</p>

<p>This year we are happy to introduce UIKonf scholarships!</p>

<p>The scholarships are different from the student tickets in two ways: 
	<ol>
		<li>They are free! Normal scholarships fully cover the conference cost. We will try to help with travel costs if we can but due to our limited budget we are not promising anything.</li>
		<li>They are merit and need based: we are looking creative and talented developers who really need our help to be able to attend the conference.</li> 
	</ol>

So you will need to fill out an <a href="http://www.uikonf.com/scholarship/">application form</a> until <b>February 15th, 2015</b> and with a little bit of luck you will hear back from us with the instructions on how to register your scholarship ticket.</p>

<p>Our goal with the scholarships is to award budding developers with limited means. So please don't apply if you are already some years into your career and have job or a stable income as a freelancer.</p>

<p>We are looking forward to reviewing your applications!</p>
