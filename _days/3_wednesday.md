    talk: Test or Go Fishing - an introduction to TDD
    description: Whilst not a panacea for your development troubles, but certainly a headache for many, Test Driven Development (or any of its incarnations) can prove something of a silver bullet if done correctly and consistently; cleaner code and shorter QA cycles are two of the best benefits. In this session, Paul will get you started with TDD in Swift, best practices and tools available. Weâ€™ll be looking at prototyping & writing tests in Playgrounds, before migrating to an Xcode project, as well as the benefit of writing various types of tests and using 3rd party frameworks.

    talk: Burn-Out, Burn-In - Focusing Your Fire of Purpose
    description: In today's world of complexity, competition and constant deadlines, we require novel skills to develop and maintain sustainable health without and within. In this workshop we will look with radical and compassionate honesty at how work affects us on our physical, mental and emotional levels. Underpinned by exciting research into mindfulness, we use meditative and body-mind practices to tackle the roots of feeling disconnected and burnt out. Participants in this workshop will learn specific tools to become more attentive to their personal limits and capacities as professionals.
