    talk: Unconscious Bias
    description: Everyone talks about the benefits of diversity and inclusion in our ever so fast-moving world. But what do we actually mean by diversity? What does an inclusive workplace look like? And more importantly, what gets in the way of us building an inclusive culture? These are the questions we’ll explore in this interactive session. You’ll learn about unconscious bias as well as the impact it has on you and your decision-making. In the second half of the session, we’ll explore practical actions for taking a more inclusive approach and what difference we can bring to our (working) environment. The number of participants is limited to 30 and you can get your ticket here.  We are offering this workshop on a PWYW basis and recommend 30 Euros per person. All proceeds will be donated to charity.

  - title: Paul Ardeleanu
    talk: Test or Go Fishing - an introduction to TDD
    description: Whilst not a panacea for your development troubles, but certainly a headache for many, Test Driven Development (or any of its incarnations) can prove something of a silver bullet if done correctly and consistently; cleaner code and shorter QA cycles are two of the best benefits. In this session, Paul will get you started with TDD in Swift, best practices and tools available. We’ll be looking at prototyping & writing tests in Playgrounds, before migrating to an Xcode project, as well as the benefit of writing various types of tests and using 3rd party frameworks.
