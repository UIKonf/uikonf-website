  - title: Paul Ardeleanu
    talk: Test or Go Fishing - an introduction to TDD
    description: Whilst not a panacea for your development troubles, but certainly a headache for many, Test Driven Development (or any of its incarnations) can prove something of a silver bullet if done correctly and consistently; cleaner code and shorter QA cycles are two of the best benefits. In this session, Paul will get you started with TDD in Swift, best practices and tools available. We’ll be looking at prototyping & writing tests in Playgrounds, before migrating to an Xcode project, as well as the benefit of writing various types of tests and using 3rd party frameworks.
