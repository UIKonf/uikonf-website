  - title: Public Speaking Workshop with Jeff Watkins
    description: We usually don't start UIKonf this early, but this workshop is a good reason to do so - If you are planning on speaking at a conference or a meetup, but are still insecure about your speaking skills, you might want to join us, too. We also offer <strong>discounted tickets</strong> for underrepresented groups in tech. <br/><a href="/workshops#public-speaking">Learn more about the workshop</a>
