**Shannon Hughes** is an iOS and Mac developer at the Omni Group. She studied Computer Science once upon a time, but had been away from it for many years by the time she purchased her first iPhone and decided to write an app while her children napped. Having come to software development after being a full-time mom, sheâ€™s still pretty jazzed that she gets paid to understand, refactor, and write code. She loves making things with code, with words, and with yarn.
