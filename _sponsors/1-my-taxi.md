<a href="https://mytaxi.com/uk/" target="_blank">mytaxi</a> was founded in June 2009 and was the world’s first taxi app that established a direct connection between a passenger and a taxi driver. With more than 10 million passengers and 100,000 drivers, mytaxi is the leading taxi e-hailing app in Europe. Since February 2019, mytaxi is part of the FREE NOW group, the ride-hailing joint venture of BMW and Daimler. Within 2019, mytaxi will rebrand to FREE NOW. We have three tech hubs: Barcelona, Hamburg and Berlin. Our daily business is solving large-scale, highly complex technical problems – and we love it.
