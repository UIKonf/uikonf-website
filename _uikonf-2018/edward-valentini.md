**Edward Valentini** is a software engineer living in San Francisco. He works on the iOS team at Fitbit.
Heâ€™s been working with iOS since its release and macOS before that. He is interested
in compiler technology and in particular loves how Swift draws influence from many languages.

**Talk: Compilers and LLVM Demystified**  
Have compilers just seemed like a big black box for you?  Have you ever wondered what happens on your code's journey from the time you write it to when it gets executed?
In this talk we want to take a close look at the LLVM compiler infrastructure used in the Swift compiler and also in many other languages.  We will use a swift wrapper
around LLVM called LLVMSwift to implement a toy compiler in Swift for an example language.
