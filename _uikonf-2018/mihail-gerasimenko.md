**Talk: ðŸ”‘ End-to-End encryption for iOS Developer**  
My talk is going to explain what end-to-end encryption (E2EE) is, the current state and the algorithms and protocols behind it as well as the challenges of implementing the truly E2EE application on the iOS platform and the future of the protocols.

In particular I would like to touch the following topics:
- Big Brother and why the privacy is important.
- Very brief historical overview of the encrypted messaging practices connected to the modern-day encryption improvements that enabled the real-time E2EE communication.
- How it applies to iOS.
- Future developments: Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol.
