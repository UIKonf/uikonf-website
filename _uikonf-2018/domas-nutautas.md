**Domas Nutautas** is an enthusiastic problem solver. In the mornings he solves edge cases with his wife, in the afternoons he works on urban mobility solutions with colleagues at Trafi, in the evenings he tries to create a better world with scouts and in the nights he dreams of crazy new problems to solve. Domas has been deep in iOS lands for the past five years. Working his way through different patterns and paradigms he binded strongly to functional reactive programming. 

**Talk: ðŸ•³ The code you donâ€™t have to write**  
Have you ever thought what's the best solution to a problem? It's the one that you don't have to write, but still works. This talk will untangle view controllers using flow coordinators. Without a single line of code coordinators can be created in Storyboards and work perfectly using Swift's amazing Type system. Where else can we write little or no code?
