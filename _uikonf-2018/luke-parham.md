**Talk: Gotta Go Fast (A Performance and Instruments Talk)**  
If you've been working on an iOS app for a while, you may have noticed that over time your once snappy app has started to feel a little sluggish. Your feed limps along with the occasional stall or maybe you're trying to build a camera app but it seems to lag quite a bit behind reality.  Contrary to popular opinion, our software is becoming increasingly demanding at a rate that easily exceeds how quickly our devices are improving.
The talk explains how to track overall performance, find performance problems and how to fix a few big ones. Sprinkled throughout are 10 Rules for Good Performance.
