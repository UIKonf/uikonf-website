<p>He has been developer since 1987 when he started writing accounting software using COBOL on a Convergent Unix machine using vi as his IDE. (Sorry Emacs people). Since then he has worked on mainframes (ICL, DEC, &amps; IBM), 16bit and 32 bit Windows, .NET and since 2007 OS X and (a little later) iOS . During his career he has learnt (and forgotten) more languages and IDE’s than is possibly healthy for one lifetime.</p>

				<p>Michael has been an iOS developer since just after the app store launched, and various incarnations before that, including Windows when NT meant New Technology and Java when it had a Mobile Edition. He has a love of music, has seen him wash up at <a href="http://www.songkick.com/" target="_blank">Songkick</a> most recently, and has only made his music snobbery worse. Also; far too fussy about what coffee and beer he drinks, and very easily upset by bad user interfaces.</p>
