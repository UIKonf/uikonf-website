<p>Agenda: The key to using Core Data successfully is an in-depth understanding of its architecture. Together with Daniel and Florian you will take a deep dive into this flexible and powerful framework to enable you to make the best choices for your project: how to setup the stack, how to implement a clean concurrency model, and how to tackle performance problems.</p>

<p>Next to the workshop itself each participant gets a copy of the <a href="https://www.objc.io/books/core-data" target="_blank">Core Data eBook</a>.</p>

<p>Prerequisites: This workshop is not for newcomers to Core Data. We assume that you have a basic understanding of Core Data’s API.</p>
