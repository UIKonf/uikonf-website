<p>This session will begin with a general introduction into the basic concepts of Realm and how it is fundamentally different from CoreData. Building on these basics, weâ€™ll explore together, how just Realm alone can be central to the architecture of reactive applications.</p>

<p>Marius has been developing mobile &amp; web applications ever since he graduated from university. In more recent years, he has shifted his focus towards mobile development, especially iOS and Objective-C, and now a much larger portion of Swift. With his work on the CocoaPods team, he hasn't forgotten about Ruby either.</p>
