In 2018 we relaunched mytaxiâ€™s passenger apps introducing new user flows and rebuilding the technical implementation. This talk focusses on the changes on technologies (app and backend), agile processes and reshaping teams during this long-term project and how we stepwise launched the product, collected feedback and addressed bugs and improvements. Topics are: modularisation, agile project management and forecasting, scaling up architectures and product teams, testing and quality improvements.<br>
