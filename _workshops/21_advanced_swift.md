<p>This fast-paced workshop shows you how to take advantage of Swift features to write more robust code that is easier to reason about. We'll spend a good part of the day looking at functional programming and playing with map, filter, reduce, and flatmap but we will also create instances of classes, structs, and enums. We'll explore how your iOS app architecture may change when you embrace idiomatic Swift.</p>

<p>One of the strengths of Swift is that it can borrow the best from a multitude of paradigms. We'll look at how to successfully weave together OO and functional code into a readable and flexible architecture and focus on protocol oriented programming.</p>

<p>Prerequisites: We assume that you are an experienced programmer who has spent some time looking at Swift but you aren't yet an expert in Swift. You understand most of the hows and whats of working with Swift and are looking for the whys and wheres. You need a Mac running Yosemite or El Capitan with the latest publicly shipping version of Xcode 7.x installed.</p>
