Whilst not a panacea for your development troubles, but certainly a headache for many, Test Driven Development (or any of its incarnations) can prove something of a silver bullet if done correctly and consistently; cleaner code and shorter QA cycles are two of the best benefits. In this session, Paul will get you started with TDD in Swift, best practices and tools available. Weâ€™ll be looking at prototyping & writing tests in Playgrounds, before migrating to an Xcode project, as well as the benefit of writing various types of tests and using 3rd party frameworks.

**Bio**:
 Paul is a software engineer, trainer and speaker specialised in data-driven solutions on mobile platforms with an emphasis on prototyping, best practices and balance with agility. He started programming back in the days of Fortran, graduated with a PhD in Computational Physics from UCLan and currently hailing from London, UK. <br> He blogs on (Medium) [http://m.pardel.net], often (tweets)[https://twitter.com/pardel] and, in his spare time, is bootstrapping (Event.Run) [https://www.event.run].
