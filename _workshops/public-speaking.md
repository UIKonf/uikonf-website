<p>Whether during a team standup, giving a presentation to a client, pitching an investor, or on stage at a conference, we all have opportunities to be in the spotlight. In the morning session, students will explore the basics of using gestures and body language, motion, and their voice to be better communicators. They&rsquo;ll also learn techniques to encourage confidence in front of an audience. In the afternoon, each student will prepare, rehearse, and record a 5 minute lightning talk.</p>

<p>Each student will receive a copy of their lightning talk as well as a presentation remote. Students should come with a laptop with Keynote installed.</p>

<p><strong>About Jeff</strong><br />
