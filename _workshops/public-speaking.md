**Public speaking Workshop**

This workshop will teach you the skills you need to feel confident whether you’re pitching an investor, proposing a project to a client, or getting up on stage at a conference or meet up. Learning how to thrive in the spotlight is an essential part of taking your career to the next level. 

In the morning session, students will learn the basics of creating a compelling presentation. They’ll learn how to understand their audience to ensure what they’re saying doesn’t fall on deaf ears.
 
In the afternoon session, students will explore the basics of using gestures, body language, motion, and their voice to be better communicators. They’ll also learn techniques to encourage confidence in front of an audience. There’s plenty of opportunity to practise. It’s not just theory.

Because our community is always in need of a diverse selection of voices, if you feel you’re a member of any under-represented group in our industry, Jeff has agreed to pay your tuition himself. Please contact scholarships@speakersunion.org for more details.

The full ticket price is 100 Euro and all proceeds will be donated to a charity organization.

**Bio**
Jeff Watkins is an iOS developer living with his daughter and four cats on beautiful Bainbridge Island, Washington. In the past he’s been an itinerant Javascript teacher with his fingers stained by dry erase markers. He lost his fear of public speaking in front of standing room only audiences of more than a thousand fellow engineers. He prefers speaking on non-technical topics at more intimate venues now. His mission is to help make public speaking a common part of the engineer’s toolkit.
