**Unconscious Bias Workshop**
Everyone talks about the benefits of diversity and inclusion in our ever so fast-moving world. But what do we actually mean by diversity? What does an inclusive workplace look like? And more importantly, what gets in the way of us building an inclusive culture?

These are the questions we’ll explore in this interactive session. You’ll learn about unconscious bias as well as the impact it has on you and your decision-making. In the second half of the session, we’ll explore practical actions for taking a more inclusive approach and what difference we can bring to our (working) environment.

The number of participants is limited to 30 and you can get your ticket here.  We are offering this workshop on a PWYW basis and recommend 30 Euros per person. All proceeds will be donated to charity.
