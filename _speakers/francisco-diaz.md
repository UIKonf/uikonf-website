<p>Francisco D&iacute;az - Captivated by code, ceaseless about self-improvement, and always eager to grow an inclusive community, Francisco&#39;s follicles bristle at the thought of his next big challenge. Francisco doesn&#39;t just build software at Axiom Zen; he builds relationships and communities, working closely with anyone willing to learn and anyone he may learn from. Case in point: Francisco is a lead organizer for Chile&#39;s only meetup for iOS developers, iOS Love.</p>
