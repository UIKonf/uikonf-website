In the last 12 years, **Daniel Jilg** has been an app and backend developer, a CTO, and a data science engineer, sometimes at the same time. He has carried through it all a desire to learn, a love for data visualisation, and a knack to pass on what I learned. Recently, his interest for anything space-related is in hyperdrive, and he wants to share a slice of what makes space travel so interesting, while tying it all to concepts we as Swift developers understand.

**Talk: Swift in Space – The N-Body Problem**
The N Body Problem is a computationally complex problem that we use to predict how planets and galaxies – and everything in between – move through space. I’ll show you some interesting ways to calculate it, and we’ll have a look at what to do, should you find yourself in a space ship’s pilot seat. When you leave this talk, you should have at least a general idea of analysis of complex algorithms as well as orbital mechanics.
