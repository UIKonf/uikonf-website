**Anastasiia Voitova** is a software engineer with plenty of experience in building mobile apps. She developed many applications, frequently taking care of both iOS and server sides of the system. Gradually she has developed the interest in computer security, and joined the forces of [Cossack Labs](https://www.cossacklabs.com/) first as open source contributor and mobile consultant, then fully immersing into the world of data security and cryptography... still staying true to the roots and applying it to the beloved iOS platform. Now her primary goal is to make the world safer place, so she speaks a lot about building secure applications.

**Talk: 10 Things you Need to Know before Implementing Cryptography**  
(Before we get deep into protocols vulnerabilities: things you should remember designing your app flow from a security point of view.)
This talk will focus on copybook headings of infosec: what you need to know before exciting stuff like cryptography and AI-assisted incident detection. Like, choice of data you show in the background mode, choice of 3rd party SDKs, which logs we send and where...
Even when developers create apps with security in minds, protect user secrets, and donâ€™t reveal unencrypted data, attackers can find ways to bypass these security measures by exploiting architectural weaknesses and unobvious, yet very simple vulnerabilities. We will talk about all the tiny bits and pieces are necessary to make your app secure against simple attacks way before focusing on the hard things (like crypto).
