<strong>You</strong> can talk at UIKonf, too. Propose a presentation through our anonymous CFP. Others will help you refine and focus it by making suggestions. Keep updating your proposal bearing those suggestions in mind.

If your proposal is selected at the end of the voting process, your travel expenses will be reimbursed and you will be our guests at our selected Hotel in Berlin. Of course, we will also reimburse your ticket if you already have purchased one.

Everything happens anonymously to focus on the content and not on the names. Remember that our Code of Conduct applies to proposals and comments as well and be nice.
