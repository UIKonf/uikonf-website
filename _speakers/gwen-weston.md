<p>Her talk: <strong>Implementing Compassion</strong><br/>
From jumping into a new programming paradigm to going into an unfamiliar codebase, there's a lot of opportunity for uncertainty and thus, a lot to be afraid of. What if we can't figure things out? What if people look upon our performance poorly? What if, after all this time, it turns out we are terrible programmers? The process of growing as a programmer and learning new things.</p>
