<p>Ilja has been developing for iOS since 2011 and since then worked on different kinds of apps from live streaming, productivity and advertisement to lifestyle and messaging.</p>
<p>Originally he is from Moscow, Russia, and there had a chance to work at one of the biggest Russian IT companies, like Mail.ru and Rambler&amp;Co. About a year ago he moved to Berlin searching for new challenges. Currently he is working at <a href="https://www.hellofresh.com/" target="_blank">HelloFresh</a> where they try to improve our users mobile cooking experience.</p>
<p>He is passionate about architecting code and trying new approaches. Currently he codes exclusively in Swift (so when he switches to Objective-C he always forgets “;”) and blogs about that from time to time.</p>
