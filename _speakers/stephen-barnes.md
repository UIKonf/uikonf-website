short-bio: iOS Developer at Fitbit, coffee lover &amp; digital artist
---

<p>Stephen is an engineer, an artist, and many things in between. He is currently a Senior iOS Developer at <a href="https://www.fitbit.com" target="_blank">Fitbit</a>, but he has previously worked on a number of things such as 3D, real-time training simulations, babysitting apps, retail apps for iOS and Android, 84″ touchscreens Mac apps, and more. Along the way he has enjoyed writing shaders in GLSL for an OpenSceneGraph based graphics engine and building useful libraries such as RZTransitions for iOS view controller transitions. And best of all, he got to work with a whole lot of really smart people to teach him things along the way. When he isn’t working on mobile apps, he enjoys digital art, West Coast Swing dancing, and cheesy sci-fi books.</p>
