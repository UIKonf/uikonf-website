**Data Trusts: What, Why, How?**  
Most apps build today collect data. Data about our health, our whereabouts, our taste, or our social connections. It helps us decide where we want to go and who we want to go with. On a collective level, it can even help us to formulate better public health policies, or climate crises reponses.   
But, without proper controls on who can collect, access and use this data, we risk undermining our democratic values and human rights.  
In this talk I put forward the concept of data trusts as a way to claw back control over the data collected about us, our processes and environment. I'll explain what data trusts are and how they are relevant for both mobile developers and society at large.
