**Gwynne Raskind** is an active and passionate contributor to the Swift ecosystem, especially in the Swift on Server space. She has made many integral contributions to the Vapor web framework, and currently develops and maintains end-to-end integrated systems in multiple languages spanning every major platform, including Windows. She also maintains a hobbyist interest in cryptography and infosec, and secretly dreams of one day returning assembly language to the forefront of computing.

**Talk: Why Is Swift So Much Better On Server?**
Swift is a powerful language, designed and built by experts, guided by an active and invested community of developers. But so many of us have experienced those awkward moments when this amazing new tool faltered, turning brittle and sharp-edged without warning. Must be growing pains, some think. Others accept it as meaning nothing can be good at everything. And still others decide it’s not for them after all. There’s a simple truth they’ve all missed.

(a dramatic pause) Swift on the desktop can never spread its wings and soar free. (the theatrical sound of a deep breath)

Come to my talk and learn about the world of Swift on Server, a whole different way of looking at and using the language, unencumbered by decades of habit or by the well-meaning chains of compatibility. Don’t worry for the loss of the crumbling dust of AppKit’s foundations or the wobbling Jenga tower of UIKit, don’t fear the absence of SwiftUI’s still-uncertain rise - watch in wonder as Swift itself is set loose like never before!
