**Esther Zahn** is a fashion tech activist. With her project [UX.FTT](http://estherzahn.com/ux-ftt) she is developing sensors and conductive elements that can be modularly integrated in textiles. Her goal is to make tech-enabled fashion not just functional but also fun to wear. 

**Talk: Since when does fashion communicate? Does technology affect fashion or fashion technology?**
In this talk, Esther will give an introduction to the possibilities of textile electronics state of the art and why it is time to develop mobile apps.
As a Fashiontech designer, Esther has been developing electronic textiles since 2012 and reports on her developments and the problems involved in bringing together two areas as diverse as technology and society.
