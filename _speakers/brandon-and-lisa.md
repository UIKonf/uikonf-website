<p><a href="”https://twitter.com/mbrandonw”" target="”_blank”">Brandon</a> and <a href="”https://twitter.com/luoser”" target="”_blank”">Lisa</a> are both Android and iOS engineers at Kickstarter. Brandon uses an iPhone and Lisa uses an Android but they still get along. Together, they have helped build the Kickstarter Android app and rewrite Kickstarter&#39;s iOS app, which Brandon once wrote in Objective-C, in Swift. They like tacos, tequila, and ergonomic keyboards. They dislike imperative programming, untestable code, and non-ergonomic keyboards.</p>
