<p><a href="”https://twitter.com/mbrandonw”" target="”_blank”">Brandon</a> and <a href="”https://twitter.com/luoser”" target="”_blank”">Lisa</a> are both Android and iOS engineers at Kickstarter. Brandon uses an iPhone and Lisa uses an Android but they still get along. Together, they have helped build the Kickstarter Android app and rewrite Kickstarter&#39;s iOS app, which Brandon once wrote in Objective-C, in Swift. They like tacos, tequila, and ergonomic keyboards. They dislike imperative programming, untestable code, and non-ergonomic keyboards.</p>

<p>Their talk: <strong>Anything you can do, I can do better</strong><br/>
At Kickstarter, Android and iOS development co-exist harmoniously. Our small team of native engineers have spent the past two years embracing functional programming, from building our Android app using RxJava to rewriting our iOS app in Swift using ReactiveSwift. We have learned a lot from a cross-platform functional workflow and will talk about how FP, Swift and Kotlin have unified our approach in writing consistent code across platforms. We will give a tour of the features of Kotlin and all its similarities, strengths, and weaknesses with respect to Swift.</p>
