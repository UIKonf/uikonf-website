**Vincent Garrigues** moved to Berlin over 5 years ago as one of SoundCloudâ€™s first in-house iOS engineers. Since then, he led numberous high profile features and spearheaded the modularization of the application as iOS platform lead. He recently moved on to be the director of engineering for media streaming.

**Talk: Scaling iOS, a story of technical debt, and how to get through it**  
You almost only hear about success stories at conferences, and I wanted to share something a little different. In 2014 we shipped a completely rewritten SoundCloud app. We made a few choices back then that had unexpected side effects later on. These mistakes affected the team, but we learned from them and designed a strategy to deal with them. Today, the SoundCloud iOS app is in the top 20 most downloaded apps in the App Store. What I would like the audience to take away from this talk is that mistakes can and will happen; what matters most is how you deal with them once you've realized things went wrong.
