Julia is a freelance iOS developer with a passion for creating delightful user interfaces. She’s currently working with a fully-remote research lab, building experimental prototypes that explore what the future of tablet computing for creativity and productivity could look like.

Julia started dabbling in graphic and web design as a young teenager, but didn’t discover her passion for programming until attending university. Flash and ActionScript first made things click for her, and a few years later she fell in love with iOS and never looked back. She’s worked for startups (Wooga, Clue) and a big companies (KAYAK) before becoming a freelancer and part-time digital nomad.

In her non-screen time, she is a DIY home improver, hobby mixologist, and hammock enthusiast.
