short-bio: iOS developer since the app store launch. Fussy about coffee &amp; easily upset by bad user interfaces.

<p>Michael has been an iOS developer since just after the app store launched, and various incarnations before that, including Windows when NT meant New Technology and Java when it had a Mobile Edition. He has a love of music, has seen him wash up at <a href="http://www.songkick.com/" target="_blank">Songkick</a> most recently, and has only made his music snobbery worse. Also; far too fussy about what coffee and beer he drinks, and very easily upset by bad user interfaces.</p>
