<p>Steve Scott (Scotty) has been a freelance developer since 1992 although he is probably best known for being the host on a number of developer podcasts including <a href="http://t.co/DYdrxRx1B3" target="_blank">The iDeveloper Podcast</a>. He was also the host and creator of NSConference.</p>

<p>He has been developer since 1987 when he started writing accounting software using COBOL on a Convergent Unix machine using vi as his IDE. (Sorry Emacs people). Since then he has worked on mainframes (ICL, DEC, &amps; IBM), 16bit and 32 bit Windows, .NET and since 2007 OS X and (a little later) iOS . During his career he has learnt (and forgotten) more languages and IDEâ€™s than is possibly healthy for one lifetime.</p>
