**Miriam Busch** had been CTO of Karlmax Berlin for more than 5 years, creating and supporting cross-functional teams working with Android, iOS and recently Flutter. In May, she joins SoundCloud as Engineering Manager. Meanwhile, she is staying at home, trying to homeschool her kids and finding some joy in plants and drawing on her iPad.	

**Talk: Cross-platform Collaboration Patterns**  
“What do you do professionally?” What is the first thing you’re saying? You’re an iOS developer, a developer for mobile apps or a software developer at $company?  
Most apps are built for iOS and Android, most also require a backend. Many teams are set up as feature teams, including developers specialized for their respective platform. Yet, how do they actually collaborate?  
We’ll talk about patterns and antipatterns I’ve seen - apps built in isolation to feature parity, from silos to cross-platform pair programming and code sharing.  
There is more than one way to collaborate with your peers. Let’s see what is in there for you and your team.
