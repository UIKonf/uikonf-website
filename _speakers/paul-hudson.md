**Paul Hudson** is the author of [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/), Pro Swift, Swift Design Patterns, Testing Swift, Server-Side Swift, Swift Coding Challenges, and more. Suffice it to say, he quite likes Swift. And coffee. (But mostly Swift.) (And coffee.)

**Who can say they have learned Swift?**  
If someone asked you ""have you learned Swift?"" your initial response might be to say ""yep, I've learned Swift!"" And perhaps you have learned some of it â€“ you might be building apps with it every day, you might have read all my Swift books and them some, or maybe you're even the tech lead on a team of Swift developers.

But have you *learned* Swift, or are you still *learning* Swift? Have you finished learning it, or are you still discovering new things every day? Are there parts of the language you have yet to discover?

In this talk I'll discuss why the constant evolution of the language means we're still trying to figure out what truly idiomatic Swift looks like, and the ramifications that has for our community.
