<p>Mischa has always been passionate about two things that don’t seem to have much in common: logic and creativity. He graduated in physics to discover the first and worked as a radio reporter for a couple of years to try out the latter. In the process he realized that the iPhone is a pretty good recording device, but the App Store was lacking an app for professional reporters at the time - the beginning of a new chapter in his life.</p>

<p>Today Mischa works as an iOS developer at intive Kupferwerk, Germany’s market leader for mobile apps and a place that combines both of his passions. He’s crazy about writing clean code in Swift and creating modular, adaptive user interfaces with Auto Layout. His favorite question: “Why?”</p>
