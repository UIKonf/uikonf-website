<p><a href="https://twitter.com/floriankugler" target="_blank">Florian</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chriseidhof" target="_blank">Chris</a> are the hosts of <a href="https://talk.objc.io/" target="_blank">Swift Talk</a>. Together, they have written and published three books about Swift and iOS development, and started objc.io. Before, they worked on Deckset, Scenery and a number of other projects.</p>
