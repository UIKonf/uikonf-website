<p>Jeff Watkins lives a quiet, isolated life with his daughter and four cats on beautiful Bainbridge Island where he divides his time between creating fiendishly clever bugs in iOS software and his real passion, a fund raising non-profit dedicated to ensuring organisations striving to make positive improvements in diversity in the technology industry don't fail for a lack of funding.</p>
