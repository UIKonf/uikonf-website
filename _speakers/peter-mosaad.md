**Talk: Conductors: It's all about communication!**
We all aim to build scalable, maintainable and robust apps - it's always going easy till our screens are getting more and more updates and new features.
Having one screen that accommodates large number of use cases / features is something that we see in almost every app.
I think everyone agrees that building such a screen and keeping it maintainable and scalable is a problem that every mobile developer is facing.
In this talk, I will be presenting on how we here at Delivery Hero, are able to solve this problem of massive screens by using Conductors.
